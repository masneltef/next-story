# Building NextStory: A Developer's Tale

This project started as a simple idea: what if I could combine my love for writing with my passion for coding?

## The Vision

I wanted to create something that was:
- Easy to use for non-technical writers
- Powered by modern web technologies
- Beautiful and fast
- Open source and extensible

## Technical Challenges

### Markdown Processing
Setting up the markdown parser was trickier than expected. I had to learn about:
- Gray-matter for frontmatter parsing
- Remark for converting markdown to HTML
- Proper TypeScript types for everything

### Dynamic Routing
Next.js's file-based routing is powerful, but getting the `[slug]` pages working with static generation took some debugging.

### Styling System
Choosing between traditional CSS, CSS modules, and Tailwind was a decision I spent way too much time on. Tailwind won because of its utility-first approach.

## Lessons Learned

1. Start simple and iterate
2. TypeScript saves you from so many bugs
3. Good documentation is as important as good code
4. The Next.js community is incredibly helpful

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add:
- Comment system
- Image optimization
- Search functionality
- RSS feed generation

The journey of building NextStory has been as rewarding as the stories it will help tell.
