# Landing My First Developer Job: From Zero to Hero

Six months ago, I was working in retail with zero coding experience. Today, I'm writing this from my desk as a junior full-stack developer. Here's the unfiltered story of how I made it happen.

## The Breaking Point

I'll never forget the moment I decided to change my life. It was 2 AM, I'd just finished another soul-crushing 12-hour shift, and I was scrolling through social media when I saw a post about someone who learned to code and doubled their salary in 6 months.

That night, I made a promise to myself: **I would become a developer, no matter what it took.**

## The Learning Phase (Months 1-4)

### Starting with the Basics

I started with freeCodeCamp because it was free (important when you're living paycheck to paycheck). My first "Hello World" felt like magic:

console.log("Hello World!");
