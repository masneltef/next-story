# My React Learning Journey

When I first encountered React, I was completely overwhelmed. Coming from vanilla JavaScript, the concept of components and JSX felt like learning a new language.

## The Breakthrough Moment

Everything clicked when I realized that React components are just functions that return HTML. That simple mental model changed everything.

## Key Concepts That Helped

1. **Think in Components** - Break everything into small, reusable pieces
2. **Props vs State** - Understanding data flow was crucial
3. **Hooks** - useState and useEffect opened up so many possibilities

## What's Next?

Now I'm building NextStory with Next.js, and it feels like magic! The server-side rendering and file-based routing make development so much smoother.

The journey continues, and every day I discover something new about the React ecosystem.
